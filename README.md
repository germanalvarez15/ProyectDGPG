# ProyectDGPG

This is a proyect that I made as a final job for the institute where I learnt game programming in 2015.

ItÂ´s a 3D shooter game, in which you have to kill all zombies and collect all the items before call for help.

I developed this game in less than one week, so it takes so much work.

Most of the 3D models are free from the Unity store.

If you prefer play the game instead see the project, you can download it from here:
