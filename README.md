UNITY 3D C#

This is a proyect that I made as a final task for the institute where I learnt game programming in 2016.

ItÂ´s a 3D shooter game, in which you have to kill all zombies and collect all the items before call for help.

I developed this game in less than one week, so it takes a lot of work.

Most of the 3D models are free from the Unity store.

If you prefer play the game instead of see the project, you can download it from here:
