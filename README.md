# ProyectDGPG

This is a proyect that I made as a final job for the institute where I learnt game programming.

ItÂ´s a 3D shooter game, in which you has to kill all zombies and collect all the items before call for help.

I developed this game in less than one week, so it takes so much work.

Most of the 3D models are free from the Unity store.
